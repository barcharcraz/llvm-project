# MSVC LLVM Fork

This is a fork of the [LLVM repository](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project) for active development using MSVC.

The [original README](..\README.md) briefly describes how to get started with LLVM. The purpose of this `README` is to understand what happens with the development inside of the MSVC fork, as well contribution guidelines. This, in its current form, is focused primarily on sanitizer and fuzzing development. OpenMP and general LLVM development take place here as well.

## Getting Started

Before cloning the repo, you'll want to take a look at the [MSVC counterpart](https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_git/msvc?path=/readme.md), which will outline some prerequisites as well as [specific steps](https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_git/msvc?anchor=__be-team__-quick-start-steps) required to quickly get started in this submodule.

## Next Steps

After you've successfully enlisted, you'll want to take a look at the contributing.md for the associated project you are working on.
